# Weather Forecasting using Machine Learning

This project focuses on **weather forecasting using machine learning techniques**, analyzing historical weather data to predict future weather-related variables. The notebook demonstrates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

---

## Project Overview

Weather forecasting is a classical time-series and regression problem.
In this project, machine learning models are applied to structured weather datasets to learn patterns and relationships among meteorological variables such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall.

The workflow is implemented entirely in a Jupyter Notebook for clarity and experimentation.
